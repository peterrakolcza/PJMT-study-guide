Notes from Mobile Application Penetration Testing Courses I took in preparation for the PJMT

## About the PJMT:

The Practical Junior Mobile Tester (PJMT) certification is a beginner-level mobile application penetration testing exam experience. The exam will assess a student’s ability to perform a mobile application penetration test at an associate level. Students will have two (2) full days to complete the assessment and an additional two (2) days to write a professional report.

In order to receive the certification, a student must:
- Exploit a mobile application using static and dynamic analysis skills as well as basic web application penetration testing skills to ultimately compromise a simulated organization’s mobile app.
- Provide a detailed, professionally written report.

## Special Thanks to TCM Security for packing these courses with tons of value!
